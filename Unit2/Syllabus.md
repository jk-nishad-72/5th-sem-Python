## 1. Introduction to Data Analysis

**Data Analysis** is the process of **collecting, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting data** to extract useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making.

In Python, data analysis is commonly done using libraries like:

* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization

## 2. Knowledge Domains of the Data Analyst

A **Data Analyst** works at the intersection of multiple domains:

### 1. **Mathematics & Statistics**

* Mean, median, mode
* Probability
* Correlation & regression
* Hypothesis testing

### 2. **Programming Skills**

* Python, R, SQL
* Data structures
* Writing efficient and readable code

### 3. **Data Handling & Management**

* Data cleaning
* Handling missing values
* Data transformation
* Working with databases

### 4. **Business / Domain Knowledge**

* Understanding the problem context
* Interpreting results meaningfully
* Making data-driven decisions

### 5. **Data Visualization**

* Charts, graphs, dashboards
* Communicating insights clearly

## 3. Understanding the Nature of the Data

Data can be classified based on **structure** and **type**.

### A. Based on Structure

1. **Structured Data**

   * Organized in rows & columns
   * Example: Excel sheets, SQL tables

2. **Unstructured Data**

   * No fixed format
   * Example: text, images, videos

3. **Semi-Structured Data**

   * Partially organized
   * Example: JSON, XML

### B. Based on Type

1. **Numerical Data**

   * Can be measured or counted
   * Example: age, salary, marks

2. **Categorical Data**

   * Represents categories or labels
   * Example: gender, city, department

## 4. The Data Analysis Process

The **Data Analysis Life Cycle** consists of the following steps:

### 1. **Define the Problem**

* Understand the objective
* What question are we trying to answer?

### 2. **Collect Data**

* From databases, files, APIs, surveys, etc.

### 3. **Clean the Data**

* Remove duplicates
* Handle missing values
* Fix incorrect data

### 4. **Explore the Data**

* Summary statistics
* Identify patterns and trends
* Visualization

### 5. **Analyze the Data**

* Apply statistical methods
* Perform comparisons
* Identify relationships

### 6. **Interpret Results**

* Convert results into insights
* Make recommendations

### 7. **Communicate Findings**

* Reports, dashboards, presentations

## 5. Quantitative and Qualitative Data Analysis

### A. Quantitative Data Analysis

Deals with **numerical data**.

#### Characteristics:

* Measurable
* Uses statistical techniques
* Objective results

#### Examples:

* Sales revenue
* Temperature
* Exam scores

#### Common Techniques:

* Mean, median, standard deviation
* Regression analysis
* Correlation analysis

---

### B. Qualitative Data Analysis

Deals with **non-numerical data**.

#### Characteristics:

* Descriptive
* Subjective
* Focuses on meaning and patterns

#### Examples:

* Customer feedback
* Reviews
* Interview responses

#### Common Techniques:

* Content analysis
* Thematic analysis
* Sentiment analysis

## 6. Quantitative vs Qualitative (Comparison)

| Feature   | Quantitative  | Qualitative           |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Data Type | Numerical     | Textual / Descriptive |
| Nature    | Objective     | Subjective            |
| Analysis  | Statistical   | Interpretative        |
| Tools     | Mean, graphs  | Themes, categories    |
| Example   | Sales numbers | Customer opinions     |
